# tic_tac_toe
TIC_TAC_TOE is a simple game written in C/C++, playable from console where two player(human + computer) can play at a time, every move that is played by human is shown in O character and X for computer move. ASCII char is used for boundaries.


update -> I have added some artificial intelligence to my game (min_max algo) to make computer player more powerfull, now it uses its best move to counter attack the oponent.
